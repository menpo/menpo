      "Cython: Optimising for speed\n",
      "============================\n",
      "This notebook aims to take the reader through a realworld example of increasing the speed on an algorithm. The given example is that of computing the normals for a given triangle mesh (points and a trilist). Computing the per-vertex normal for a mesh is an intensive operation that yields poor performance in pure Python. This is due to the need to loop over every triangle and and sum the per-triangle normal that every vertex is a member of. This notebook is not designed to describe Cython syntax or basics. It is assumed that the reader has some understanding and preferably experience with writing Cythonised functions.\n",

Our previous optimisation was almost certainly the largest jump in performance we will be able to achieve. Given that we don't gave any other loops, we are unlikely to get large 100+% jumps in performance. Numpy calls are already vectorized and manually unrolling them in to loops will not yield a very big performance boost. If we run the magic function ``%prun``, this will give us profiling information about the functions that are called.
