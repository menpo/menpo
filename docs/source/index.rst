Welcome to Menpo's documentation.

If you are new to Menpo, we strongly recommend you check out the

that you may wish to explore the

examples for all aspects of Menpo that you can execute for yourself.

Finally, Menpo's source is extensively documented. If you have a question about
the behaviour of a particular class or function you should head to the the
