Quick Start
===========
Here we give a very quick rundown of the basic links and information sources
for the project.

Basic Installation
------------------
Menpo should be installable via pip on all major platforms:

::

    $ pip install menpo

However, in the menpo team, we **strongly** advocate the usage of conda for
scientific Python, as it makes installation of compiled binaries much more
simple. In particular, if you wish to use any of the related Menpo projects
such as *menpofit*, *menpo3d* or *menpodetect*, you will not be able to easily
do so without using conda.

::

    $ conda install -c menpo menpo

To install using conda, please see the thorough instructions for each platform
on the `Menpo website <http://www.menpo.org/installation/>`_.

API Documentation
-----------------
:ref:`Visit API Documentation <api-index>`

Menpo is extensively documented on a per-method/class level and much
of this documentation is reflected in the API Documentation.
If any functions or classes are missing, please bring it to the attention
of the developers on `Github <https://github.com/menpo/menpo>`_.

Notebooks
---------
`Explore the Menpo Notebooks <http://www.menpo.org/notebooks.html>`_

For a more thorough set of examples, we provide a set of Jupyter notebooks
that demonstrate common use cases of Menpo. This concentrates on an overview
of the functionality of the major classes and ideas behind Menpo.

User Group and Issues
---------------------
If you wish to get in contact with the Menpo developers, you can do so
via various channels. If you have found a bug, or if any part of Menpo behaves
in a way you do not expect, please raise an issue on
`Github <https://github.com/menpo/menpo>`_.

If you want to ask a theoretical question, or are having problems installing
