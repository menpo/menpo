    def repeat(self, n):

        Repeat each item of the underlying LazyList ``n`` times. Therefore,
        if a list currently has ``D`` items, the returned list will contain
        ``D * n`` items and will return immediately (method is lazy).

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : `int`
            The number of times to repeat each item.

        Returns
        -------
        lazy : `LazyList`
            A LazyList where each element returns each item of the provided
            iterable, optionally with `f` applied to it.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from menpo.base import LazyList
        >>> ll = LazyList.init_from_list([0, 1])
        >>> repeated_ll = ll.repeat(2)  # Returns immediately
        >>> items = list(repeated_ll)   # [0, 0, 1, 1]

        Generate an efficient copy of this LazyList - copying the underlying
        callables will be lazy and shallow (each callable will **not** be
        called nor copied) but they will reside within in a new `list`.

        -------
        ``type(self)``
            A copy of this LazyList.

    def __add__(self, other):
        r"""
        Create a new LazyList from this list and the given list. The passed list
        items will be concatenated to the end of this list to give a new
        LazyList that contains the concatenation of the two lists.

        If a Python list is passed then the elements are wrapped in a function
        that just returns their values to maintain the callable nature of
        LazyList elements.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : `collections.Sequence`
            Sequence to concatenate with this list.

        Returns
        -------
        lazy : `LazyList`
            A new LazyList formed of the concatenation of this list and
            the ``other`` list.

    Return a partial function but the __doc__ attached to the returned

    func : `callable`

    args : ...

    kwargs : `dict`

    ----------

        The object who's landmarks and path, if any, will be copied
    target : :map:`Landmarkable`
        The object who will have landmarks and path set on
