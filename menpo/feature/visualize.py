    Create the sum of the channels of an image that can be used for
    visualization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixels : :map:`Image` or subclass or ``(C, X, Y, ..., Z)`` `ndarray`
        Either the image object itself or an array with the pixels. The first
        dimension is interpreted as channels.
    channels : `list` of `int` or ``None``
        The list of channels to be used. If ``None``, then all the channels are
        employed.

def glyph(pixels, vectors_block_size=10, use_negative=False, channels=None):
    r"""
    Create the glyph of a feature image that can be used for visualization. If
    `pixels` have negative values, the `use_negative` flag controls whether
    there will be created a glyph of both positive and negative values
    concatenated the one on top of the other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixels : :map:`Image` or subclass or ``(C, X, Y, ..., Z)`` `ndarray`
        Either the image object itself or an array with the pixels. The first
        dimension is interpreted as channels.
    vectors_block_size : `int`
        Defines the size of each block with vectors of the glyph image.
    use_negative : `bool`
        Defines whether to take into account possible negative values of
        feature_data.
    channels : `list` of `int` or ``None``
        The list of channels to be used. If ``None``, then all the channels are
        employed.
