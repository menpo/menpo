class AbstractPWA(Alignment, Transform, Invertible):
    r"""
    A piecewise affine transformation.

    This is composed of a number of triangles defined be a set of `source` and
    `target` vertices. These vertices are related by a common triangle `list`.
    No limitations on the nature of the triangle `list` are imposed. Points can
    then be mapped via barycentric coordinates from the `source` to the `target`
    space. Trying to map points that are not contained by any source triangle
    throws a `TriangleContainmentError`, which contains diagnostic information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : :map:`PointCloud` or :map:`TriMesh`
        The source points. If a TriMesh is provided, the triangulation on
        the TriMesh is used. If a PointCloud is provided, a Delaunay
        triangulation of the source is performed automatically.
    target : :map:`PointCloud`
        The target points. Note that the trilist is entirely decided by the
        source.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Source and target must both be 2D.
