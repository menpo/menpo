class Alignment(Targetable, Viewable):
    r"""
    Mix-in for :map:`Transform` that have been constructed from an optimisation
    aligning a source :map:`PointCloud` to a target :map:`PointCloud`.

    This is naturally an extension of the :map:`Targetable` interface - we just
    augment :map:`Targetable` with the concept of a source, and related methods
    to construct alignments between a source and a target.

    Note that to inherit from :map:`Alignment`, you have to be a
    :map:`Transform` subclass first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : :map:`PointCloud`
        A PointCloud that the alignment will be based from
    target : :map:`PointCloud`
        A PointCloud that the alignment is targeted towards

        Checks that the dimensions and number of points match up of the source
        and the target.

        Parameters
        ----------

            A PointCloud that the alignment will be based from
        target : :map:`PointCloud`
            A PointCloud that the alignment is targeted towards

        ------

            Source and target must have the same number of points
