    r"""
    Smart data importer. Will match all files found on the glob pattern
    passed in, build the relevant importers, and then call ``build()`` on them
    to return a list of usable objects.

    It makes it's best effort to import and attach relevant related
    information such as landmarks. It searches the directory for files that
    begin with the same filename and end in a supported extension.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pattern : String
        The glob style pattern to search for textures and meshes.
    meshes: bool, optional
        If ``True``, include mesh types in results

        Default: ``True``
    images: bool, optional
        If ``True``, include image types in results

        Default: ``True``
    include_texture_images: bool, optional
        If ``True``, check if the images found in the glob pattern are actually
        textures of the meshes it found.
        If this is the case, it won't import these images separately.

        Default: ``False``
    max_meshes: positive integer, optional
        If not ``None``, only import the first max_mesh meshes found. Else,
        import all.

        Default: ``None``
    max_images: positive integer, optional
        If not ``None``, only import the first max_images found. Else,
        import all.

        Default: ``None``

    Examples
    --------
    Look for all meshes that have file extension ``.obj``:

        >>> auto_import('*.obj')

    Look for all files that begin with the string ``test``:

        >>> auto_import('test.*')

    Assuming that in the current directory that are two files, ``bunny.obj``
    and ``bunny.pts``, which represent a mesh and it's landmarks, calling

        >>> auto_import('bunny.obj')

    Will create a mesh object that **includes** the landmarks automatically.
