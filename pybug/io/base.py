    Makes it's best effort to import and attach relevant related

    Furthermore, this method attempts to handle mixed assets (e.g. textured
    meshes in the same folder as images) without 'double importing' anything.

    Note that this is a generator function. This allows for pre-processing
    of data to take place as data is imported (e.g. cropping images to

    Parameters
    ----------
    pattern : String
        The glob path pattern to search for textures and meshes.
    max_meshes: positive integer, optional
        If not ``None``, only import the first max_mesh meshes found. Else,

    max_images: positive integer, optional
        If not ``None``, only import the first max_images found. Else,
        import all.

        Default: ``None``

    Yields
    ------
    asset
        Assets found to match the glob pattern provided.

    Examples
    --------
    Import all meshes that have file extension ``.obj``:

        >>> meshes = list(import_auto('*.obj'))

    (note the cast to a list as auto_import is a generator and we want to
    exhaust it's values)

    Look for all files that begin with the string ``test``:

        >>> test_images = list(import_auto('test.*'))

    Assuming that in the current directory that are two files, ``bunny.obj``
    and ``bunny.pts``, which represent a mesh and it's landmarks, calling

        >>> bunny = list(import_auto('bunny.obj'))

    Will create a mesh object that **includes** the landmarks automatically.
